# Agent Instructions for three-axis-chess

This file provides a minimal set of guidelines for automated or assisted contributions.

## Style Guidelines

- Use 2 spaces for indentation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.
- Keep variable and function names descriptive.
- Maintain the simple single-page structure; avoid adding build steps.

## Testing / Validation

- There are no automated tests. After modifying HTML, CSS, or JS files,
  open `3dchess20.html` or `refactored/index.html` in a browser to ensure the game loads
  and there are no console errors.

## PR Summary

When creating a pull request, include:

- A short description of the changes made.
- Any manual validation steps performed.
- References to modified file paths and relevant line numbers when helpful.

## Special Policies

- Do not introduce new dependencies or complex build tools without prior discussion.
- Note any TODOs or follow-up work directly in comments within the code.
